# SPH README

This is a repository for my SPH Code, and I aim to have varying levels of code committed, allowing you to see how each one has been modified and how that has affected the performance of the code. 

INPUT:
At present, the program requires no input. Functionality to provide an input for the boundary and starting zone may be added at some point, but at a secondary priority. 

OUTPUT: 
The output of the program is a .plt file ready to do an animation in tecplot360EX, with strands and timestamps for animation. No plans to port to other filetypes. 

TO DO:
1. Add a working surface tension model.
2. Look at viscosity models. Does additional viscosity need to be added?
3. Experiment with different smoothing kernels.
4. Extend to 3-D.
